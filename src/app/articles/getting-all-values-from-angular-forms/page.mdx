Ever wondered what the difference was between accessing the `.value` property on a [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup) and calling the `getRawValue()` method on a [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup)? Don't they both return the current value of the [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup)? Well, technically yes, but there's a gotcha case in which you won't get the expected value of the [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup)if you use the `.value` property.

Let's setup a quick [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup) so that a user can input a zipCode and have the city and state auto populate in their respective fields and take a look.

```typescript
constructor(private fb: FormBuilder){}

this.locationForm = this.fb.nonNullable.group({
      state: [
        { value: 'A Really Nice State', disabled: true },
      ],
      city: [
        { value: 'Some Cool City', disabled: true },
      ],
      zipCode: [
        '12345',
        [Validators.minLength(5), Validators.maxLength(5)],
      ],
    });
```

Now that we have our [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup) set up and populated with a few FormControls that all have values, let's get the value of the entire [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup).

```typescript
const value = this.locationForm.value

// value will equal {zipCode: '12345'}
```

Wait a minute. Why am I only getting the value for the zipCode FormControl?!?!

The `city` and `state` are missing in the output even though they have values because they are in a `disabled` state. If I want to get all values I would have to do this...

```typescript
const value = this.locationForm.getRawValue()
```

In this case now `value` will contain all of the FormControl values:

```typescript
console.log('value =>', value) // value => {state: 'A Really Nice State', city: 'Some Cool City', zipCode: '12345'}
```

It's on of those things that you easily miss if you're not paying attention as the read the documentation. Here is the snippet for the `.value` property on for AbstractControl (the base class for FormControl, [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup), and FormArray)

and the snippet for `getRawValue()` method for AbstractControl,

and for [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup),
