# Jocleyn's Personal Site

This is my personal site, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. I know, I know, "But Jocelyn, you're like an expert in Angular, why are you using React and Nextjs!"
This is true. I have a TON of Angular experience, but I'm not a one trick pony! At the end of the day, I'm a web developer and I love building useful things with software and a framework or library
is simply a tool to help you build. A good craftsman has many tools in thier toolbelt and whilst I don't
get the opportunity to work with Nextjs professionally, I like to pull it out and sharpen my tools
for when the day does come that I need to use it on a large production application. I knew if I built my personal site with Nextjs and thus have to maintain it over time,
I'd be forced to get nice and cozy with it and have plenty of opportunity to learn more about it.
