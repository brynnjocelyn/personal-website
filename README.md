# Jocleyn's Personal Site

This is my personal [site](https://jocelynknight.dev), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).
I know what you're thinking, "But [Jocelyn](https://jocelynknight.dev), you're like an expert in [Angular](https://angular.dev), why are you
using [React](https://react.dev) and [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org)!"
This is true. I have a **TON** of [Angular](https://angular.dev) experience, but I'm not a one trick pony!

At the end of the day, I'm a software developer and I love building useful things with software and a framework or library
is simply a tool to help you build.

A good craftsman has many tools in thier toolbelt and whilst I don't
get the opportunity to work with Nextjs professionally, I like to pull it out and sharpen my tools
for when the day does come that I need to use it on a large production application.

I knew if I built my personal site with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org) and thus have to maintain it over time,
I'd be forced to get nice and cozy with it and have plenty of opportunity to learn more about it.
